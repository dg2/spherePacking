# Feature Space Sphere Packing for Clustering Sets of Vectors
This repository contains the original Matlab code (adapted to also work in Octave) for the algorithm presented in *Feature Space Sphere Packing for Clustering Sets of Vectors* (Garcia-Garcia et al, ICASSP 2011) and in the future will also host alternative versions:
* Python
* Julia
